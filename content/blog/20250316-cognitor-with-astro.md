Generally speaking, rather than creating your own authentication system it better
to use a third party system. That way at least you know you are using something created
by people whose sole focus is secure authentication. It saves you to work on the actual
goals of your business.

One such service you can use is [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/).
This over will give you an overview on how integrate this into you app.

As a quick overview, here is how Cognito could work with your site.

![Cognito user flow](/images/cognito-in-astro/user-flow.png)

1. User clicks on the login button in your app.
2. The page redirects to a login/registration page hosted by Cognito
3. On a successful login, Cognito redirects back to your page and stores user data and tokens in Session storage.

Remember that this is only one possible authentication flow. Many of AWS's products
allow for fine grained controll over how you achieve your business.

Setting up Cognito is quite simple but requires you to get your head around a few concepts.

1. Once logged into your AWS account you create a new User Pool. Think of this as
   a new container for you users. You can create create as many as you like. One for each user.
2. Once created, select the User Pool and create a new App Client. This is you AWS hosted login page.
3. Select the "Quick setup guide" and then the platform you are working with. This will give you the
   starter code that you need.
4.
